## Problem
As millennials, we learn Math, Science, History and pretty much most things from online sources like YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Coursera, etc. However, we noticed that these videos tend to be super long and we often lack the attention span to absorb the information.

## Solution
We wanted to make learning more fun and accessible. Since we spend so much of our time on Instagram, we thought of using Instagram's addictive user experience to make learning more fun. That is how InstaLearn was born.

## Research
Can we monetize our solution to this problem? That is the question we wanted to answer with [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlSyZzMYVaKR8ZQ-NQXchG87uXgT7TtILZ6ZYHjGvxONLE8Q/viewform?usp=send_form).

## How we built it
We built the backend and frontend using Android Studio and Java. We used InVision to create the logo and other original assets used in this app. We did not use any Instagram API to build this - we tried to recreate as much of the UI as we could.

## Development
Clone this repo to your machine and open instalearner in Android Studio. Build. Run.
